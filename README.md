# ITOPS-ontology
Authors: Rosario Uceda-Sosa, Nandana Mihindukulasooriya, Sahil Bansal, Seema Nagar, Atul Kumar, Vikas Agarwal, Gaetano Rossiello, Alfio Gliozzo IT Operations ontologies files in TTL. 

Special thanks to Salim Roukos, Ruchi Mahindru and Yu Deng for their help and advice. 

The IT Operations ontology is built from a domain agnostic pipeline that leverages information from Wikidata, Wikipedia and DBPedia. There are three stages in the current pipeline, each extending the previous ones by using a variety of symbolic and ML/DL techniques. 

The outcome of each stage is a turtle (.ttl) file, ITOPS_S1.ttl, ITOPS_S2.ttl and ITOPS_S3.ttl which can be deployed separately and installed in a triplestore. 

Pls check in the ITOPS_README.pdf file for details and sample queries.
